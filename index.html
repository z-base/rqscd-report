    <section id="abstract">
      <p>
        This report asks one simple question: which remote-signing risks still
        exist even when current ETSI controls are in place?
      </p>
      <p>
        Core point: a signature can pass technical checks, but there can still
        be a dispute about whether the signer approved that exact content.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document does not solve those risks. It shows where they remain and
        what evidence is missing when disputes happen.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="scope-and-method">
      <h2>Scope and Method</h2>
      <p>
        Scope: qualified remote signatures where signing is triggered through a
        service run by a trust service provider under eIDAS [[EIDAS910]]
        [[EIDAS2024_1183]].
      </p>
      <p><strong>Threat qualification rule:</strong></p>
      <p>
        A scenario is included only when it can still happen even if current
        ETSI controls are in place.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Attacker classes in scope:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A compromised or impersonating app/frontend with a valid session.
        </li>
        <li>Privileged insider misuse in internal remote-signing systems.</li>
        <li>Missing record of exact trust data used at validation time.</li>
        <li>
          Activation evidence that stays internal and cannot be independently
          replayed by third parties.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Each scenario is presented in one consistent format:
        <strong>THREAT</strong>, <strong>MITIGATION</strong>, and
        <strong>RESIDUAL</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is simple: show which controls are already in force, what an
        independent party can verify today, and what still remains disputed.

    </section>

    <section id="legal-and-standards-baseline">
      <h2>Legal and Standards Baseline</h2>
      <p>
        eIDAS Article 25 says an electronic signature cannot be denied legal
        effect only because it is electronic [[EIDAS910]].
      </p>
      <p>
        eIDAS Article 26(c) and Annex II require signature-creation data to be
        controlled and protected so others cannot validly trigger signing events
        [[EIDAS910]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Regulation (EU) 2024/1183 updates eIDAS and sets the legal framework for
        remote qualified-signature components and related transition rules
        [[EIDAS910]] [[EIDAS2024_1183]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/1567 points to ETSI standards as the
        technical baseline used in this report [[EIDAS2025_1567]]
        [[ETSI119431_1]] [[ETSI319401]].
      </p>
      <p>
        When EU law pins a specific standard version, that pinned version is
        the legal reference for conformance checks [[EIDAS2025_1567]].
      </p>
      <p>
        ETSI TS 119 432 defines the remote-signing API model, but it does not
        itself define the full client authentication method [[ETSI119432]].
      </p>
      <p>
        These controls reduce risk, but they do not automatically make every
        signer-intent claim independently replayable in a dispute.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="system-model-and-trust-boundaries">
      <h2>System Model and Trust Boundaries</h2>
      <p><strong>Assets:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Signature key activation state.</li>
        <li>SAD and activation decisions.</li>
        <li>DTBS/DTBSR linkage from display to signature input.</li>
        <li>Validation-time trust material (OCSP/CRL/TL/LOTL).</li>
        <li>Audit and event logs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Main boundary split:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          What third parties can usually verify directly: signature bytes,
          certificate chain, revocation status, and trusted-list state
          [[EIDAS910]] [[TL2015_1505]].
        </li>
        <li>
          What often stays inside the provider: user-intent path details,
          activation internals, and internal log semantics [[ETSI119431_1]]
          [[ETSI319401]] [[ETSI119431_2]].
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This split is the main reason residual dispute risk remains.

      <h2>Residual Scenarios and Evidence Gaps</h2>
      <p>
        This report keeps four residual scenarios that can still exist under the
        current ETSI baseline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Format per scenario: <strong>THREAT</strong>,
        <strong>MITIGATION</strong> (controls in force), and
        <strong>RESIDUAL</strong> (what still cannot be independently proven).
      </p>

      <h3>R1: Show A, Sign B</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>THREAT:</strong> A compromised frontend keeps valid
        authentication/session and submits content B after showing content A.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>MITIGATION:</strong> Session and activation controls plus
        remote-signing API model [[ETSI119431_1]] [[ETSI119432]].
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RESIDUAL:</strong> Independent proof that signer saw and
        approved the same document and terms that were finally signed.
      </p>

      <h3>R2: Privileged Internal Misuse</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>THREAT:</strong> Someone with high internal access abuses that
        access and gets a valid signature created, even though no key is
        exported.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>MITIGATION:</strong> ETSI requires access control, role
        separation, monitoring, and audit controls for service components
        [[ETSI319401]] [[ETSI119431_2]].
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RESIDUAL:</strong> In a dispute, an external reviewer may still
        lack event-level proof that this exact activation was free from
        privileged misuse.
      </p>

      <h3>R3: Missing Validation Snapshot</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>THREAT:</strong> At decision time, the service does not keep a
        complete record of the trust data it used (for example certificate
        status and trusted-list state).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>MITIGATION:</strong> Validation and trusted-list framework
        [[EIDAS910]] [[TL2015_1505]].
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RESIDUAL:</strong> Later replay may not match the original
        decision because the exact validation inputs are not fully reproducible.
      </p>

      <h3>R4: Evidence Stays Inside the Provider</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>THREAT:</strong> Critical activation evidence remains internal,
        so third-party dispute replay is incomplete.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>MITIGATION:</strong> Logging and governance obligations
        [[ETSI319401]] [[ETSI119431_2]].
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RESIDUAL:</strong> External parties may still be unable to
        verify the full intent-related event history without relying on provider
        narrative.
