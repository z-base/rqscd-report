4.2 PP overview 
This Protection Profile is established by CEN as a European standard for products to create electronic 
signatures. It fulfils requirements of directive3 1999/93/ec of the European parliament and of the council of 
13 December 1999 on a community framework for electronic signatures. 
In accordance with article 9 of this European direct ive this standard can be indicated by the European 
commission in the Official Journal of the European Communities as generally recognised standard for 
electronic signature products. 
This protection profile defines security functional requirements and security assurance requirements that 
comply with those defined in Annex III of the directive for a secure signature creation device (SSCD). This 
secure signature creation device is the target of evaluation (TOE) for this protection profile. 
European Union Member States may presume that ther e is compliance with the requirements laid down 
in Annex III of the directive when an electronic signatur e product is evaluated to a Security Target (ST) 
that is compliant with this Protection Profile (PP). 
This Protection Profile about secure signature creation device with key generation and trusted 
communication with signature creation applicatio n (PP SSCD KG TCSCA) in cludes the security 
requirements for SSCD with key generation generating si gnature creation data (SCD) and creating digital 
signature to be used for (qualified or advanced) elec tronic signatures as described in the core PP [7]. 
Additionally, the TOE of this PP supports a trusted communication with a signature creation application 
for protection of authentication data and data to be signed. These securi ty features allow using the TOE 
in a more complex operational environment. It conforms  to the core PP SSCD KG [7]. The implication of 
this conformance claim is explained in section 5.3 hereinafter. 
The assurance level for this PP is EAL4 augmented with AVA_VAN.5. 
This European directive is referred to in this PP as “the directive”.

4.3 TOE overview 
4.3.1 Operation	of	the	TOE	 
This section presents a functional overview of the TOE in its distinct operational environments: 
—	 The preparation environment, where it interacts with a certification servic e provider through a 
certificate generation applicati on (CGA) to obtain a certificate for the signature validation data 
(SVD) corresponding with the signature creati on data (SCD) the TOE has generated. The 
initialization environment interacts further with the TOE to personalize it with the initial value of 
the reference authentication data (RAD). 
—	 The signing environment where it interacts with a signer through a signat ure creation application 
(SCA) to sign data after authenticating the si gner as its signatory. The signature creation 
application provides the data to be signed (DTBS), or a unique representation thereof (DTBS/R) 
as input to the TOE signature creation function and obtains the resulting electronic signature
4. 
The TOE and the SCA communicate through a trusted channel to ensure the integrity of the 
DTBS respective DTBS/R. 
—	 The management environments where it interacts with the user or an SSCD-provisioning service 
provider to perform management operations, e.g.  for the signatory to reset a blocked RAD. A 
single device, e.g. a smart card terminal, may provide the required secure environment for 
management and signing. 
The signing environment, the management environment and the preparation environment are secure and 
protect data exchanged with the TOE. Figure 5 in Part 1 [6] of this standard illustrates the operational 
environment. 
The TOE stores signature creation data and reference authentication data. The TOE may store multiple 
instances of SCD. In this case the TOE provides a function to identify each SCD and the signature 
creation application (SCA) can provide an interface to the signer to select an SCD for use in the signature 
creation function of the SSCD. The TOE protects the confidentiality and integrity of the SCD and restricts 
its use in signature creation to its signatory. T he electronic signature created with the TOE is a qualified 
electronic signature as defined in the directive  if the certificate for the SVD  is a qualified certificate 
(Annex I). Determining the state of the certificate as qualified is beyond the scope of this standard. 
The SCA is assumed to protect the integrity of the input it provides to the TOE signature creation function 
as being consistent with the user data authorized for signing by the signatory. Unless implicitly known to 
the TOE, the SCA indicates the kind of the signing in put (as DTBS/R) it provides and computes any hash 
values required. The TOE may augment the DTBS/R with signature parameters it stores and then 
computes a hash value over the input as needed by  the kind of input and the used cryptographic 
algorithm. The TOE and the SCA communicate through a tr usted channel in order to protect the integrity 
of the DTBS/R. 
The TOE stores signatory reference authentication data  to authenticate a user as its signatory. The RAD 
is a password e.g. PIN, a biometric template or  a combination of these. The TOE protects the 
confidentiality and integrity of the RAD. The TOE ma y provide a user interface to directly receive 
verification authentication data (VAD) from the user , alternatively, the TOE receive the VAD from the 
4	 At a pure functional level the SSCD creates an electronic signature; for an implementation of the 
SSCD, in that meeting the requirements of this PP and with the key certificate generated as specified 
in the directive, Annex I, the result of the si gning process can be used as to create a qualified 
electronic signature.

signature creation application. If the signature cr eation application handles requesting obtaining a VAD 
from the user, it is assumed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of this data. 
A certification service provider an d a SSCD-provisioning serv ice provider interact with the TOE in the 
secure preparation environment to perform any preparation function of the TOE required before control of 
the TOE is given to the legitimate user. These functions may include: 
 initialising the RAD, 
 generating a key pair, 
 storing personal information of the legitimate user. 
A typical example of an SSCD is a smart card. In this case a smart card terminal may be deployed that 
provides the required secure environment to handle a request for signatory authorization. A signature can 
be obtained on a document prepared by a signature creation application component running on personal 
computer connected to the card terminal. The si gnature creation application, after presenting the 
document to the user and after obtai ning the authorization PIN initiates the electronic signature creation 
function of the smart card through the terminal. 
4.3.2 Target	of	evaluation	 
The TOE is a combination of hardware and software configured to securely create, use and manage 
signature creation data (SCD). The SS CD protects the SCD during its whole lifecycle as to be used in a 
signature creation process solely by its signatory. 
The TOE comprises all IT security functionality nec essary to ensure the secrecy of the SCD and the 
security of the electronic signature. 
The TOE provides the following functions: 
(1) 	 to generate signature creation data (SCD) and the correspondent signature verification data 
(SVD), 
(2) 	 to export the SVD for certification, 
(3) 	 to, optionally, receive and store certificate info, 
(4) 	 to switch the TOE from a non-operational state to an operational state, and 
(5) 	 if in an operational state, to create electronic signatures for data with the following steps: 
(a) 	 select an SCD if multiple are present in the SSCD, 
(b) 	 authenticate the signatory and determine its intent to sign, 
(c) 	 receive data to be signed or a unique repr esentation thereof (DTBS/R) through a trusted 
channel with SCA, 
(d) 	 apply an appropriate cryptographic signature creation function using the selected SCD to 
the DTBS/R. 
The TOE may implement its function for electronic signature creation to also conform to the specifications 
in ETSI TS 101 733 (CAdES) [8], ETSI TS 101 903 (XAdES) [9] and ETSI TS 101 903 (PAdES) [10]. 
4.3.3 TOE	lifecycle	 
The TOE lifecycle is the same as defined in the PP SSCD KG [7], section 4.3.3.

5 Conformance cl aims 
5.1 CC conformance claim 
This PP uses the Common Criteria version 3.1 Revision 4 (see chapter 10 hereinafter). 
This PP is conforming to Common Criteria Part 2 [3] extended. 
This PP is conforming to Common Criteria Part 3 [4]. 
5.2 PP claim, Package claim 
This PP is strictly conforming to the core PP SSCD KG [7] version 2.0.1 as dated of 2012-01-23. 
This PP is conforming to assurance package EAL4 augmented with AVA_VAN.5 defined in CC part 3 [4]. 
5.3 Conformance rationale 
This PP SSCD KG TCSCA conforms to the core PP SSCD KG [7]. This implies for this PP: 
(1) 	 The TOE type of this PP SSCD KG TCSCA is the same as the TOE type of the core PP SSCD 
KG: the TOE is a combination of hardware and software configured to securely create, use and 
manage signature creation data. 
(2) 	 The security problem definition (SPD) of th is PP SSCD KG TCSCA contains the security 
problem definition of the core PP SSCD KG. T he SPD for the SSCD KG TCSCA is described 
by the same threats, organisational security policies and assumptions as for the TOE in core 
PP SSCD KG. 
(3) 	 The security objectives for the TOE in this  PP SSCD KG TCSCA include all the security 
objectives for the TOE of the core PP SSCD KG and add the security objective 
OT.TOE_TC_VAD_Imp (Trusted channel of TOE for VAD import) and OT.TOE_TC_DTBS_Imp 
(Trusted channel for DTBS). 
(4) 	 The security objectives for the operational environment in this PP SSCD KG TCSCA include all 
security objectives for the operational env ironment of the core PP SSCD KG except 
OE.HI_VAD and OE.DTBS_Protect. This PP adapts OE.HI_VAD and OE.DTBS_Protect to the 
support provided by the TOE by new securi ty functionality (cf. OT.TOE_TC_VAD_Imp, 
OT.TOE_TC_DTBS_Imp) provided by the TOE and changes them into OE.HID_TC_VAD_Exp 
and OE.SCA_TC_DTBS_Exp (cf. 7.2 for details). 
(5) 	 The SFRs specified in this PP SSCD KG TCSCA includes all security functional requirements 
(SFRs) specified in the core PP SSCD KG. Additional SFRs address trusted channel between 
the TOE and the SCA: FDP_UIT.1/DTBS, FTP_ITC.1/VAD and FTP_ITC.1/DTBS. 
(6) This PP SSCD KG TCSCA does not provide completion of all operations left to the ST writer in 
the core PP SSCD KG. This PP provides refinements for the SFR FIA_UAU.1 of the core PP.

(7) 	 The SARs specified in this PP SSCD KG TCSCA includes all SAR as specified in the core PP 
SSCD KG. It does not include additional SAR not included in the core PP SSCD KG. 
Further information about the relation of this PP and the core PP are given in sectio ns 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 7.1.1 
and 7.2.1. 
5.4 Conformance statement 
This PP requires strict conformance of the ST or PP claiming conformance to this PP. 
6 Security probl em de f i n i ti o n 
6.1 Assets, users and threat agents 
The Common Criteria define assets as entities that  the owner of the TOE presumably places value upon. 
The term “asset” is used to describe the threats in the operational environment of the TOE. The assets of 
this PP SSCD Type TCSCA are the same as of the core PP SSCD KG [7]. 
Assets and objects: 
1. 	 SCD: private key used to perform an electronic signature operation. The confidentiality, integrity 
and signatory’s sole control over the use of the SCD must be maintained. 
2. 	 SVD: public key linked to the SCD and used to perform electronic signature verification. The 
integrity of the SVD when it is exported must be maintained. 
3. 	 DTBS and DTBS/R: set of data, or its representation, which the signatory intends to sign. Their 
integrity and the unforgeability of the link to the signatory provided by the electronic signature 
must be maintained. 
Users and subjects acting for users: 
1. 	 User: End user of the TOE who can be identifie d as administrator or signatory. The subject 
S.User may act as S.Admin in the role R.Admin or as S.Sigy in the role R.Sigy. 
2. 	 Administrator: User who is in charge to perfo rm the TOE initialisation, TOE personalisation or 
other TOE administrative functions. The subject S.Admin is acting in the role R.Admin for this 
user after successful authentication as administrator. 
3. 	 Signatory: User who hold the TOE and use it on their own behalf or on behalf of the natural or 
legal person or entity they represent. The subject S.Si gy is acting in the role R.Sigy for this user 
after successful authentication as signatory. 
Threat agents 
1. 	 Attacker: Human or process acting on their behalf located outside the TOE. The main goal of the 
attacker is to access the SCD or to falsify the electronic signature. The attacker has got a high 
attack potential and knows no secret.

6.2 Threats 
This PP includes all threats of the core PP SSCD KG [7]: T.SCD_Divulg, T.SCD_Derive, T.Hack_Phys, 
T.SVD_Forgery, T.SigF_Misuse, T.DTBS_Forgery and T.Sig_Forgery. 
This PP does not define any additional threats. 
6.3 Organisational security policies 
This PP includes all organisational security policies of the core PP SSCD KG [7]: P.CSP_Qcert, P.Qsign, 
P.Sigy_SSCD and P.Sig_Non-Repud. 
This PP does not define any additional organisational security policies. 
6.4 Assumptions 
This PP includes all assumptions of the core PP SSCD KG [7]: A.CGA and A.SCA. 
This PP does not define any additional assumptions about the operational environment. 
7 Security objectives 
7.1 Security objectives for the TOE 
7.1.1 Relation to core PP SSCD KG 
This PP includes all security objectives for the TOE as defined in the core PP SSCD KG [7]: 
OT.Lifecycle_Security, OT.SCD/SVD_Gen, OT.SCD_Unique, OT.SCD_SVD_Corresp, 
OT.SCD_Secrecy, OT.Sig_Secure, OT.Sigy_SigF, OT.DTBS_Integr ity_TOE, OT.EMSEC_Design, 
OT.Tamper_ID and OT.Tamper_Resistance. 
This PP describes the following additional security objectives for the TOE: 
7.1.2 OT.TOE_TC_VAD_Imp Trusted channel of TOE for VAD import 
The TOE shall provide a trusted channel for the prot ection of the confidentiality and integrity of the VAD 
received from the HID as needed by the authentication method employed. 
Application note 1: This security objective for the TOE is partly covering OE.HID_VAD from the core PP. 
While OE.HID_VAD in the core PP requires only the operational environment to protect VAD, this PP 
requires the HID and the TOE to implement a trusted channel for the protection of the VAD: the HID 
exports the VAD and establishes one end of the trus ted channel according to OE.HID_TC_VAD_Exp, the 
TOE imports VAD at the other end of the trusted ch annel according to OT.TOE_TC_VAD_Imp. Therefore 
this PP re-assigns partly the VAD protection from the operational environment as described by 
OE.HID_VAD to the TOE as described by OT.T OE_TC_VAD_Imp and leaves only the necessary 
functionality by the HID.

prEN 14169-5:2012 (E) 
7.1.3 OT.TOE_TC_DTBS_Imp Trusted channel of TOE for DTBS import 
The TOE shall provide a trusted channel to the SCA to detect alteration of the DTBS/R received from the 
SCA. The TOE must not generate electronic signatures with the SCD for altered DTBS. 
Application note 2: This security objective for the TOE is part ly covering OE.DTBS_Protect from the 
core PP. While OE.DTBS_Protect in the core PP r equires only the operational environment to protect 
DTBS, this PP requires the SCA and the TOE to implement a trusted channel for the protection of the 
DTBS: the SCA exports the DTBS and establishes one end of the trusted channel according to 
OE.SCA_TC_DTBS_Exp, the TOE imports DTBS at the other end of the trusted channel according to 
OT.TOE_TC_DTBS_Imp. Therefore this PP re-assigns  partly the DTBS protection from the operational 
environment as described by OE.DTBS_Protect to the TOE as described by OT.TOE_TC_DTBS_Imp 
and leaves only the necessary functionality by the SCA. 
7.2 Security objectives for the operational environment 
7.2.1 Relation to core PP 
This PP includes the security objectives for the ope rational environment as defined in the core PP SSCD 
KG [7]: OE.SVD_Auth, OE.CGA_Qcert, OE.SSCD_Prov_Service, OE.DTBS_Intend and OE.Signatory. 
This PP substitutes OE.HI_VAD from the core PP by OE.HID_TC_VAD_Exp and OE.DTBS_Protect from 
the core PP by OE.SCA_TC_DTBS_Exp as follows: 
7.2.2 OE.HID_TC_VAD_Exp Trusted channel of HID for VAD export 
The HID provides the human interface for user au thentication. The HID will ensure confidentiality and 
integrity of the VAD as needed by the authentication method employed including export to the TOE by 
means of a trusted channel. 
Application note 3: This security objective for the TOE is partly covering OE.HID_VAD from the core PP. 
While OE.HID_VAD in the core PP requires only the operational environment to protect VAD, this PP 
requires the HID and the TOE to implement a trusted channel for the protection of the VAD: the HID 
exports the VAD and establishes one end of the trus ted channel according to OE.HID_TC_VAD_Exp, the 
TOE imports VAD at the other end of the trusted ch annel according to OT.TOE_TC_VAD_Imp. Therefore 
this PP re-assigns partly the VAD protection from the operational environment as described by 
OE.HID_VAD to the TOE as described by OT.T OE_TC_VAD_Imp and leaves only the necessary 
functionality by the HID. 
7.2.3 OE.SCA_TC_DTBS_Exp Trusted channel of SCA for DTBS export 
The SCA provides a trusted channel to the TOE for the protection of the integrity of the DTBS to ensure 
that the DTBS/R cannot be altered undetected in transit between the SCA and the TOE. 
Application note 4: This security objective for the TOE is part ly covering OE.DTBS_Protect from the 
core PP. While OE.DTBS_Protect in the core PP r equires only the operational environment to protect 
DTBS, this PP requires the SCA and the TOE to implement a trusted channel for the protection of the 
DTBS: the SCA exports the DTBS and establishes one end of the trusted channel according to 
OE.SCA_TC_DTBS_Exp, the TOE imports DTBS at the other end of the trusted channel according to 
OT.TOE_TC_DTBS_Imp. Therefore this PP re-assigns  partly the DTBS protection from the operational 
environment as described by OE.DTBS_Protect to the TOE as described by OT.TOE_TC_DTBS_Imp 
and leaves only the necessary functionality by the SCA.

The following table shows how the security objecti ves for the TOE and the security objectives for the 
environment cover the threats, organizational security policies and assumptions. Take note that this PP 
describes the same threats, organisational security policies and assumptions as the core PP, with the 
following two exceptions: 
OE.HID_VAD from the core PP has been split into the objectives OE.HID_TC_VAD_Exp and 
OT.TOE_TC_VAD_Imp in this PP, i.e. a part of a security objective for the environment (namely 
OE.HID_VAD from the core PP) will be met by the TOE itself, which is allowed according to CC. 
OE.DTBS_Protect from the core PP has been split into OE.SCA_TC_DTBS_Exp and 
OT.TOE_TC_DTBS_Imp in this PP, i.e. a part of a security objective for the environment (namely 
OE.DTBS_Protect from the core PP) will be met by the TOE itself, which is allowed according to CC.

7.3.2 Security	objectives	sufficiency	 
The rationale for T.Hack_Phys, T.SCD_Divulg , T.SCD_Derive, T.Sig_Forgery, T.SVD_Forgery, 
P.CSP_QCert, P.QSign, P.Sigy_SSCD, A.CGA and A.SC A remains unchanged as given in the core PP 
SSCD KG [7], section 7.3.2. The rationale how secu rity objectives address the threats T.DTBS_Forgery 
and T.SigF_Misuse and policy P.Sig_Non-Repud changes as described below. 
T.SigF_Misuse (Misuse of the signature cr eation function of the TOE ) addresses the threat of misuse of 
the TOE signature creation function to create SDO by others than the signatory to create an electronic 
signature on data for which the signatory has not expressed the intent to sign, as required by 
paragraph 1(c) of Annex III. OT.Lifecycle_Security (Lifecycle security) requires the TOE to detect flaws 
during the initialisation, personalisation and operational usage including secure destruction of the SCD, 
which may be initiated by the signatory. OT.Sigy_Si gF (Signature creation function for the legitimate 
signatory only) ensures that the TOE provides the si gnature creation function for the legitimate signatory 
only. OE.DTBS_Intend (Data intended to be signed) ensures that the SCA sends the DTBS/R only for 
data the signatory intends to sign. The combinatio n of OT.TOE_TC_DTBS_Imp (Trusted channel of TOE 
for DTBS) and OE.SCA_TC_DTBS_Exp (Trusted channel of SCA for DTBS) counters the undetected 
manipulation of the DTBS during the transmission fo rm the SCA to the TOE. OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE 
(DTBS/R integrity inside the TOE) prevents the DTBS/R from alteration inside the TOE. If the SCA 
provides a human interface for user authenticati on, OE.HID_TC_VAD_Exp (Trusted channel of HID for 
VAD) requires the HID to protect the confidentialit y and the integrity of the VAD as needed by the 
authentication method employed. The HID and the TO E will protect the VAD by a trusted channel 
between HID and TOE according to OE.HID_TC_VAD_Exp (Trusted channel of HID for VAD) and 
OT.TOE_TC_VAD_Imp (Trusted channel of TOE for VAD). OE.Signatory (Security obligation of the 
signatory) ensures that the signatory checks that an SCD stored in the SSCD when received from an 
SSCD-provisioning service pr ovider is in non-operational state, i.e. the SCD cannot be used before the 
signatory becomes control over the SSCD. OE.Signato ry (Security obligation of the signatory) ensures 
also that the signatory keeps their VAD confidential. 
T.DTBS_Forgery (Forgery of the DTBS/R) addresses the threat arising from modifications of the DTBS/R 
sent to the TOE for signing which than does not correspond to the DTBS/R corresponding to the DTBS

prEN 14169-5:2012 (E) 
the signatory intends to sign. The threat T.DTBS _Forgery is addressed by the security objectives 
OT.TOE_TC_DTBS_Imp (Trusted channel of TOE for DTBS) and OE.SCA_TC_DTBS_Exp (Trusted 
channel of SCA for DTBS), which ensure that the DTBS/R is sent through a trusted channel and cannot 
be altered undetected in transit between the SCA and the TOE. The TOE counters internally this threat by 
the means of OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE (DTBS/R integrity inside the TOE) ensuring the integrity of the 
DTBS/R inside the TOE. The TOE IT environment al so addresses T.DTBS_Forgery by the means of 
OE.DTBS_Intend, which ensures that the trustworth y SCA generates the DTBS/R of the data that has 
been presented as DTBS and which the signatory intends to sign in a form appropriate for signing by the 
TOE. 
P.Sig_Non-Repud ( Non-repudiation of signatures ) deals with the repudiation of signed data by the 
signatory, although the electronic signature is su ccessfully verified with the SVD contained in their 
certificate valid at the time of signature creation. Th is policy is implemented by the combination of the 
security objectives for the TOE and its operational en vironment, which ensures the aspects of signatory’s 
sole control over and responsibility for the electronic signatures generated with the TOE. 
OE.SSCD_Prov_Service (Authentic SSCD provided by  SSCD-provisioning service) ensures that the 
signatory uses an authentic TOE, initialised and  personalised for the signatory. OE.CGA_QCert 
(Generation of qualified certificates) ensures that the certificate allows to identify the signatory and thus to 
link the SVD to the signatory. OE .SVD_Auth (Authenticity of the SVD ) and OE.CGA_QCert (Generation 
of qualified certificates) require the environment to en sure authenticity of t he SVD as being exported by 
the TOE and used under sole control of the signatory. OT.SCD_SVD_Corresp (Correspondence between 
SVD and SCD) ensures that the SVD exported by the TOE corresponds to the SCD that is stored in the 
TOE. OT.SCD_Unique (Uniqueness of the signature creation data) provides that the signatory’s SCD can 
practically occur just once. 
OE.Signatory (Security obligation of the signatory) ensures that the signatory checks that the SCD, stored 
in the SSCD received from an SSCD provisioning servic e is in non-operational state (i.e. the SCD cannot 
be used before the signatory becomes into sole co ntrol over the SSCD). OT.Sigy_SigF (Signature 
creation function for the legitimate signatory only) pr ovides that only the signatory may use the TOE for 
signature creation. As prerequisite OE.Signatory (Sec urity obligation of the signatory) ensures that the 
signatory keeps their VAD confidential. The confidenti ality of VAD is protected during the transmission 
between the HI device and TOE according to OE.HID _TC_VAD_Exp (Trusted channel of HID for VAD) 
and OT.TOE_TC_VAD_Imp (Trusted channel of TOE for VAD). OE.DTBS_Intend (SCA sends data 
intended to be signed), OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE (DTBS/R integrity inside the TOE), 
OE.SCA_TC_DTBS_Exp (Trusted channel of SC A for DTBS) and OT.TOE_TC_DTBS_Imp (Trusted 
channel of TOE for DTBS) ensure that the TOE generat es electronic signatures only for a DTBS/R that 
the signatory has decided to sign as DTBS. The robust cryptographic techniques required by 
OT.Sig_Secure (Cryptographic securi ty of the electronic signature) ensure that only this SCD may 
generate a valid electronic signature that can be succ essfully verified with the corresponding SVD used 
for signature verification. The security objective for the TOE OT.Lifecycle_Security (Lifecycle security), 
OT.SCD_Secrecy (Secrecy of the signature cr eation data), OT.EMSEC_Design (Provide physical 
emanations security), OT.Tamper_ID (Tamper detection) and OT.Tamper_Resistance (Tamper 
resistance) protect the SCD against any compromise. 
Extend ed component s de f i n i ti o n 
The additional family FPT_EMS (TOE Emanation) of t he Class FPT (Protection of the TSF) is defined in 
the core PP SSCD KG [7]. This PP uses the extended component FPT_EMS.1 as defined in [7].

9 Security requirement s 
9.1 Security functional requirements 
9.1.1 Use	of	requirement	specifications	 
Common Criteria allow several operations to be performed on functional requirements; refinement, 
selection, assignment, and iteration. Each of thes e operations is used in this PP. Operations not 
performed in this PP are identified in order to enable instantiation of the PP into a Security Target (ST). 
A refinement operation is used to add detail to a require ment, and thus further restricts a requirement. 
Refinement of security requirements is (i) denoted by the word “refinement” in bold text and the added or 
changed words are in bold text, or (ii) included in text as bold text and marked by a footnote. In cases 
where words from a CC requirement were deleted, a se parate attachment indicates the words that were 
removed. 
A selection operation is used to select one or more options  provided by the CC in stating a requirement. 
A selection that has been made in this European standard is indicated as underlined text and the original 
text of the component is given by a footnote. Selections left to be filled in by the ST author appear in 
square brackets with an indication that a selection is to be made, [selection:], and are italicized. 
An assignment operation is used to assign a specific value to an unspecified parameter, such as the 
length of a password. An assignment that that has been made in this European standard is indicated as 
underlined text and the original text of the component is given by a footnote. Assignments left to be filled 
in by the ST author appear in square brackets wi th an indication that an assignment is to be made 
[assignment:], and are italicized. 
An iteration operation is used when a component is repeated with varying operations. Iteration is 
denoted by showing a slash “/”, and the iteration indicator after the component identifier. 
This PP requires the following SFR as descri bed in the core PP SSCD KG [7]: FCS_CKM.1, 
FCS_CKM.4, FCS_COP.1, FDP_ ACC.1/SCD/SVD_Generation, FDP_AFC.1/SCD/SVD_Generation,

(4) [assignment: list of additional TSF-mediated actions]5 
on behalf of the user to be performed before the user is authenticated. 
FIA_UAU.1.2	 The TSF shall require each us er to be successfully authenticated before 
allowing any other TSF-mediated actions on behalf of that user. 
Application note 5: The ST writer shall perform the missing ope ration in the element FIA_UAU.1.1. The 
list of additional TSF-mediated actions may be empty (i.e. assignment “none”). This PP performed the 
operation of the bullet (3) in the element FIA_UAU.1.1 of the core PP [7] by adding the establishment of a 
trusted channel to HID.

established by the HID to send the VAD. The ST writer shall perform the missing operations in the 
element FTP_ITC.1.3. If the TSF does not enforce the use of trusted channel for other functions the 
operation in the element FTP_ITC.1.3 is “none”. Note the VAD needs protection depending on the 
authentication methods employed: VAD for authent ication by knowledge needs protection in 
confidentiality; VAD for biometric authentication may need protection in integrity only. 
9.1.4 FTP_ITC.1/DTBS Inter-TSF trusted channel – Signature creation Application 
Hierarchical to: No other components. 
Dependencies: No dependencies. 
FTP_ITC.1.1/DTBS	 The TSF shall provide a communication channel between itself and another

9.3.2 TOE	security	requirements	sufficiency 
The table demonstrates that each security objective for the TOE is covered by at least one security 
functional requirement. 
The rationale in the core PP SSCD KG, section 9.3.2, is  still valid. It explains how the security functional 
requirements cover the security objectives for th e TOE OT.Lifecycle_Security, OT.SCD/SVD_Gen, 
OT.SCD_Unique, OT.SCD_SVD_Corresp, OT.SCD_ Secrecy, OT.Sig_Secure, OT.Sigy_SigF, 
OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE, OT.EMSEC_Design, OT.Tamper_ID and OT.Tamper_Resistance. The 
rationale for the security objectives OT.TOE_TC_VAD_Imp, OT.TOE_TC_DTBS_Imp is given below. 
OT.TOE_TC_VAD_Imp (Trusted channel of TOE for VAD import) is provided by FTP_ITC.1/VAD to 
provide a trusted channel to protect the VAD provided by the HID to the TOE.

9.3.4 Rationale	for	chosen	security	assurance	requirements	 
The assurance level for this protection profile is EAL4 augmented. EAL4 allows a developer to attain a 
reasonably high assurance level without the need for highly specialized processes and practices. It is 
considered to be the highest level that could be applied to an existing product line without undue expense 
and complexity. As such, EAL4 is appropriate for commercial products that can be applied to moderate to 
high security functions. The TOE described in this pr otection profile is just such a product. Augmentation 
results from the selection of: 
AVA_VAN.5 Advanced methodical vulnerability analysis 
The TOE is intended to function in a variety of signature creation systems for (qualified) electronic 
signatures. Due to the nature of its intended applicat ion, i.e., the TOE may be issued to users and may 
not be directly under the control of tr ained and dedicated administrators. As  a result, it is imperative that 
misleading, unreasonable and conflicting guidance is  absent from the guidance documentation, and that 
secure procedures for all modes of operation have been addressed. Insecure states should be easy to 
detect. The TOE shall be shown to be highly resistant to penetration attacks to meet the security 
objectives OT.SCD_Secrecy, OT.Sigy_SigF and OT.Sig_Secure.
