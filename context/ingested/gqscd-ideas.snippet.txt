Globally Qualified Signature Creation Device (GQSCD) Core GQSCD-Core defines how hardware, firmware, operating system, and application components on an end-user device can provide verifiable signature-creation properties aligned to qualified-signature security objectives ( [EU-910/2014] , [EU-2016/650] ). This specification is technical and does not itself grant legal qualification ( [EU-910/2014] , [EU-TRUSTED-LISTS] ). This is an unofficial draft. AI assistance disclosure: this draft used OpenAI GPT-5 Codex for drafting support, structure proposals, and editorial rewrites. Human editor review determined normative content, accepted/rejected changes, and final wording. Source currency note: linked source pages were checked on February 17, 2026 and February 18, 2026. Scope This specification covers: Defines a component security profile for end-user signing devices ( [EU-910/2014] , [EU-2016/650] ). EU qualification mappings in this specification target [=qualified signature creation device=] outcomes. Defines outcome invariants and verifier behavior, while leaving implementation architecture and optimization choices to implementers. Defines explicit threat assumptions and non-trust assumptions ( [ETSI-319401] ). Defines a primary Web Profile and an EU Compatibility Profile ( [WEBCRYPTO-L2] , [WEBAUTHN-L3] , [EU-2024/2982] ). Defines a mapping from GQSCD properties to eIDAS Annex II style objectives ( [EU-910/2014] , [EU-2016/650] ). Positioning and Adoption Model This specification defines web-native, verifier-checkable device-assurance evidence for signature-creation security outcomes. Adoption is expressed by stakeholder action chains: goal -> required artifact/interface -> verifier behavior -> adoption pathway . Implementing specifications may profile this core for platform-specific delivery while preserving the same conformance and verification semantics. Stakeholder Goal Required artifact/interface Verifier behavior Adoption pathway Device and platform manufacturers Ship signer-controlled key-custody and intent-assurance controls Device evidence records, attestation outputs, and discovery metadata Verify key non-exportability, approval binding, and state evidence against policy Publish conformance targets and implementation profiles for assessed configurations Wallet and app implementers Deliver end-user controlled signing and attestation flows User-approved-object binding artifacts and verifiable signing-event evidence Reject signing results lacking deterministic proof and payload equality evidence Publish profile conformance evidence and avoid remote-by-default custody patterns Standards development organizations (SDOs) Create interoperable profiles and test suites Profile specifications, test assertions, and registry/discovery rules Run deterministic pass/fail checks against declared profile requirements Standardize profile work items and reuse common terminology and evidence formats Governments and regulators Support recognition procedures without conflating legal status and cryptographic validity Authoritative registries/discovery endpoints and status publication procedures Separate technical verification output from legal-recognition determination Publish compatibility-profile rules over the web profile baseline Auditors, CABs, and assessors Evaluate implementation evidence with machine-verifiable checks Test assertions, evaluation procedures, and evidence corpora Validate cryptographic proofs and reproducible requirement mappings Issue assessment outcomes bound to reproducible artifacts instead of narrative-only claims Verifiers and relying parties Make deterministic acceptance/rejection decisions Evidence records, discovery metadata, and policy input independent of UI labels Verify every security claim cryptographically and report explicit failure reasons Adopt classed conformance verification and policy overlays per jurisdiction The key words MUST , MUST NOT , REQUIRED , SHALL , SHALL NOT , SHOULD , SHOULD NOT , RECOMMENDED , MAY , and OPTIONAL are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [[RFC2119]] [[RFC8174]] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals. REQ-GQSCD-54: Requirement drafting follows W3C conformance conventions and ETSI-style security requirement traceability; each normative requirement in this specification has an explicit identifier in the form REQ-GQSCD-## , and each conformance report MUST map satisfied requirements to this document's section anchors ( [ETSI-319401] , GDIS conformance reporting , GQTS conformance reporting ). REQ-GQSCD-55: A conforming implementation MUST satisfy all requirements of at least one conformance class in this document. REQ-GQSCD-56: Conformance MUST be evaluated against externally verifiable security outcomes and deterministic verifier outputs defined by this specification; conformance criteria MUST NOT depend on any specific internal architecture, vendor API, chipset family, operating-system brand, or implementation technique.
