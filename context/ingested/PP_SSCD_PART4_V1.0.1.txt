4.2 PP overview 
This Protection Profile is established by CEN as a European standard for products to create electronic 
signatures. It fulfils requirements of directive3 1999/93/ec of the European parliament and of the council of 
13 December 1999 on a community framework for electronic signatures. 
In accordance with article 9 of this European direct ive this standard can be indicated by the European 
commission in the Official Journal of the European Communities as generally recognised standard for 
electronic signature products. 
This protection profile defines security functional requirements and security assurance requirements that 
comply with those defined in Annex III of the directive for a secure signature creation device (SSCD). 
This secure signature creation device is the target of evaluation (TOE) for this protection profile. 
European Union Member States may presume that ther e is compliance with the requirements laid down 
in Annex III of the directive  when an electronic signature product is  evaluated to a Security Target (ST) 
that is compliant with this Protection Profile (PP). 
This Protection Profile about secure signature creation device with key generation and trusted 
communication with certificate generation applicati on (PP SSCD KG TCCGA) defines the security 
requirements for SSCD generating signature creati on data (SCD) and creating advanced electronic 
signatures, which if based on valid qualified certificates are qualified electronic signatures, as described in 
the core PP SSCD KG [7]. Additionally the TOE of this PP supports its authentication as SSCD by the 
certificate generation application (C GA) of the Certification service provider (CSP) and a trusted 
communication with this CGA for protection of signature verification data (SVD) generated and exported 
by the TOE and imported by CGA. These security features allow a changed lifecycle of the TOE. This PP 
conforms to the core PP SSCD KG [7]. The implication of this conformance claim is explained in section 
5.3 hereinafter. 
The assurance level for this PP is EAL4 augmented with AVA_VAN.5. 
3 This European directive is referred to in this PP as “the directive”.

4.3 TOE overview 
4.3.1 Operation	of	the	TOE	 
This section presents a functional overview of the TOE in its distinct operational environments: 
—	 The preparation environment, where it interacts with a certification servic e provider through a 
certificate generation applicati on (CGA) to obtain a certificate for the signature validation data 
(SVD) corresponding with the signature creation data (SCD) the TOE has generated. The TOE 
exports the SVD through a trusted channel allowi ng the CGA to check the authenticity of the 
SVD. The initialization environment interacts further with the TOE to personalize it with the initial 
value of the reference authentication data (RAD). 
—	 The signing environment where it interacts with a signer through a signat ure creation application 
(SCA) to sign data after authenticating the signe r as its signatory. The signature creation 
application provides the data to be signed or a uni que representation thereof (DTBS/R) as input 
to the TOE signature creation function and obtains the resulting electronic signature4. 
—	 The management environments where it interacts with the user or an SSCD-provisioning service 
provider to perform management operations, e.g.  for the signatory to reset a blocked RAD. A 
single device, e.g. a smart card terminal, may provide the required secure environment for 
management and signing. 
The signing environment, the management environment and the preparation environment are secure and 
protect data exchanged with the TOE. Figure 4 in Part 1 [6] of this standard illustrates the operational 
environment. 
The TOE stores signature creation data and reference authentication data. The TOE may store multiple 
instances of SCD. In this case the TOE provides a function to identify each SCD and the signature 
creation application (SCA) can provide an interface to the signer to select an SCD for use in the signature 
creation function of the SSCD. The TOE protects the confidentiality and integrity of the SCD and restricts 
its use in signature creation to its signatory. T he electronic signature created with the TOE is a qualified 
electronic signature as defined in the directive  if the certificate for the SVD  is a qualified certificate 
(Annex I). Determining the state of the certificate as qualified is beyond the scope of this standard. 
The SCA is assumed to protect the integrity of the input it provides to the TOE signature creation function 
as being consistent with the user data authorized for signing by the signatory. Unless implicitly known to 
the TOE, the SCA indicates the kind of the signing in put (as DTBS/R) it provides and computes any hash 
values required. The TOE may augment the DTBS/R with signature parameters it stores and then 
computes a hash value over the input as needed by  the kind of input and the used cryptographic 
algorithm. 
The TOE stores signatory reference authentication data  to authenticate a user as its signatory. The RAD 
is a password e.g. PIN, a biometric template or  a combination of these. The TOE protects the 
confidentiality and integrity of the RAD. The TOE ma y provide a user interface to directly receive 
verification authentication data (VAD) from the user , alternatively, the TOE receive the VAD from the 
4	 At a pure functional level the SSCD creates an electronic signature; for an implementation of the 
SSCD, in that meeting the requirements of this PP and with the key certificate generated as specified 
in the directive, Annex I, the result of the si gning process can be used as to create a qualified 
electronic signature.

signature creation application. If the signature creati on application handles, is requesting or obtaining a 
VAD from the user, it is assumed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of this data. 
A certification service provider an d a SSCD-provisioning serv ice provider interact with the TOE in the 
secure preparation environment to perform any preparation function of the TOE required before control of 
the TOE is given to the legitimate user. These functions may include: 
 initialising the RAD, 
 generating a key pair, 
 storing personal information of the legitimate user.  
The TOE and the CGA communicate through a trusted channel in order to protect the integrity and 
authenticity of the SVD exported from the TOE. 
A typical example of an SSCD is a smart card. In this case a smart card terminal may be deployed that 
provides the required secure environment to handle a request for signatory authorization. A signature can 
be obtained on a document prepared by a signature creation application component running on personal 
computer connected to the card terminal. The si gnature creation application, after presenting the 
document to the user and after obtai ning the authorization PIN initiates the electronic signature creation 
function of the smart card through the terminal. 
4.3.2 Target	of	evaluation	 
The TOE is a combination of hardware and software configured to securely create, use and manage 
signature creation data (SCD). The SS CD protects the SCD during its whole lifecycle as to be used in a 
signature creation process solely by its signatory. 
The TOE comprises all IT security functionality nec essary to ensure the secrecy of the SCD and the 
security of the electronic signature. 
The TOE provides the following functions: 
(1) 	 to generate signature creation data (SCD) and the correspondent signature verification data 
(SVD), 
(2) 	 to export the SVD for certification through a trusted channel to the CGA, 
(3) 	 to prove the identity as SSCD to external entities, 
(4) 	 to, optionally, receive and store certificate info, 
(5) 	 to switch the TOE from a non-operational state to an operational state, and 
(6) 	 if in an operational state, to create digital signatures for data with the following steps: 
(a) 	 select an SCD if multiple are present in the SSCD, 
(b) 	 authenticate the signatory and determine its intent to sign, 
(c) 	 receive data to be signed or a unique representation thereof (DTBS/R), 
(d) 	 apply an appropriate cryptographic signature creation function using the selected SCD to 
the DTBS/R. 
The TOE may implement its function for electronic signature creation to also conform to the specifications 
in ETSI TS 101 733 (CAdES) [8], ETSI TS 101 903 (XAdES) [9] and ETSI TS 101 903 (PAdES) [10]. 
The TOE is prepared for the signatory's use by 
(1) 	 generating at least one SCD/SVD pair, and 
(2) 	 personalising for the signatory by storing in the TOE: 
(a) the signatory’s reference authentication data (RAD) 
(b) optionally, certificate info for at least one SCD in the TOE. 
After preparation the SCD shall be in a non-operational state. Upon receiving a TOE the signatory shall 
verify its non-operational state and change the SCD state to operational.

prEN 14169-4:2012 (E) 
After preparation the intended, legitimate user should be informed of the signatory’s verification 
authentication data (VAD) required for use of the TOE in signing. If the VAD is a password or PIN, the 
means of providing this information is expected to  protect the confidentiality and the integrity of the 
corresponding RAD. 
If the use of an SCD is no longer requi red, then it shall be destroyed (e .g. by erasing it from memory) as 
well as the associated certificate info, if any exists. 
4.3.3 TOE	lifecycle	 
The TOE lifecycle is the same as defined in the PP SSCD KG [7], section 4.3.3, except the following: 
	 In the preparation stage of the usage phase, the SSCD-provisioning provider additionally initializes the 
security functions in the TOE for the identificati on as SSCD, for the proof of this SSCD identity to 
external entities, and for the protected export of the SVD. 
	 In the preparation stage of the usage phase, th e SSCD-provisioning provider additionally links the 
identity of the TOE as SSCD and the identity of the legitimate user as potential applicant for 
certificates for SVD generated by the TOE. 
	 In the usage phase, SCD/SVD generation by the TOE and SVD export from the TOE may take place 
in the preparation stage and/or in the operational use stage. The TOE then provides a trusted channel 
to the CGA protecting the integrity of the SVD. 
	 In the usage phase, before generating the certific ate including the SVD exported from the TOE, the 
CGA additionally establishes (1) the identity of t he TOE as SSCD, (2) that the originating SSCD has 
been personalized for the applicant for the certificate as legitimate user, and (3) the correspondence 
between SCD stored in the SSCD and the received SVD.

5.3 Conformance rationale 
This PP SSCD KG TCCGA conforms to the core PP SSCD KG [7]. This implies for this PP: 
(1) 	 The TOE type of this PP SSCD KG TCCGA is the same as the TOE type of the core PP 
SSCD KG: the TOE is a combination of har dware and software configured to securely 
create, use and manage signature creation data. 
(2) 	 The security problem definition (SPD) of this  PP SSCD KG TCCGA contains the security 
problem definition of the core PP SSCD KG. The SPD for the SSCD KG TCSCA is described 
by the same threats, organisational security policies and assumptions as for the TOE in core 
PP SSCD KG. 
(3) 	 The security objectives for the TOE in this PP SSCD KG TCCGA include all the security 
objectives for the TOE of the core PP SSCD KG and add the security objective 
OT.TOE_SSCD_Auth (Authentication proof as  SSCD) and OT.TOE_TC_SVD_Exp (Trusted 
channel for SVD). 
(4) 	 The security objectives for the operational environment in this PP SSCD KG TCCGA include 
all security objectives for the operationa l environment of the core PP SSCD KG except 
OE.SSCD_Prov_Service. This PP subs titutes OE.SSCD_Prov_Service by 
OE.Dev_Prov_Service and adds OE.CGA_SSCD_Auth and OE.CGA_TC_SVD_Imp in order 
to address the extended security functionality of the TOE and methods of use (cf. section 0 
for details). 
(5) 	 The SFRs specified in this PP SSCD KG TCCGA includes all security functional 
requirements (SFRs) specified in the core PP SSCD KG. This PP includes additional SFRs 
FIA_API.1, FDP_DAU.2/SVD and FTP_ITC.1/SVD. 
(6) 	 This PP SSCD KG TCCGA does not provide completion of all operations left to the ST writer 
in the core PP SSCD KG. This PP provides operation of the SFR FIA_UAU.1 of the core PP. 
(7) 	 The SARs specified in this PP SSCD KG TCSCA includes all SAR specified in the core PP 
SSCD KG. It does not include additional SAR not included in the core PP SSCD KG. 
Further information about the relation of this PP and the core PP are given in sectio ns 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 7.1.1 
and 7.2.1. 
5.4 Conformance statement 
This PP requires strict conformance of the ST or PP claiming conformance to this PP. 
6	 Security problem definition 
6.1 Assets, users and threat agents 
The Common Criteria define assets as entities that  the owner of the TOE presumably places value upon. 
The term “asset” is used to describe the threats in the operational environment of the TOE. The assets of 
this PP are the same as of the core PP SSCD KG [7].

prEN 14169-4:2012 (E) 
Assets and objects: 
1. 	 SCD: private key used to perform an electronic signature operation. The confidentiality, integrity 
and signatory’s sole control over the use of the SCD must be maintained. 
2. 	 SVD: public key linked to the SCD and used to perform electronic signature verification. The 
integrity of the SVD when it is exported must be maintained. 
3. 	 DTBS and DTBS/R: set of data, or its representation, which the signatory intends to sign. Their 
integrity and the unforgeability of the link to the signatory provided by the electronic signature 
must be maintained. 
Users and subjects acting for users: 
1. 	 User: End user of the TOE who can be identifie d as administrator or signatory. The subject 
S.User may act as S.Admin in the role R.Admin or as S.Sigy in the role R.Sigy. 
2. 	 Administrator: User who is in charge to perfo rm the TOE initialisation, TOE personalisation or 
other TOE administrative functions. The subject S.Admin is acting in the role R.Admin for this 
user after successful authentication as administrator. 
3. 	 Signatory: User who hold the TOE and use it on their own behalf or on behalf of the natural or 
legal person or entity they represent. The subject S.Si gy is acting in the role R.Sigy for this user 
after successful authentication as signatory. 
Threat agents: 
1. 	 Attacker: Human or process acting on their behal f located outside the TOE. The main goal of the 
attacker is to access the SCD or to falsify t he electronic signature. The attacker has got a high 
attack potential and knows no secret. 
6.2 Threats 
This PP includes all threats of the core PP SSCD KG [7]: T.SCD_Divulg, T.SCD_Derive, T.Hack_Phys, 
T.SVD_Forgery, T.SigF_Misuse, T.DTBS_Forgery and T.Sig_Forgery. 
This PP does not define any additional threats. 
6.3 Organisational security policies 
This PP includes all organisational security policies of the core PP SSCD KG [7]: P.CSP_Qcert, P.Qsign, 
P.Sigy_SSCD and P.Sig_Non-Repud. 
This PP does not define any additional organisational security policies.

6.4 Assumptions 
This PP includes all assumptions of the core PP SSCD KG [7]: A.CGA and A.SCA. 
This PP does not define any additional assumptions about the operational environment. 
7 Security objectives 
7.1 Security objectives for the TOE 
7.1.1 Relation to core PP SSCD KG 
This PP includes all security objectives for the TOE as defined in the core PP SSCD KG [7]: 
OT.Lifecycle_Security, OT.SCD/SVD_Gen, OT.SCD_Unique, OT.SCD_SVD_Corresp, 
OT.SCD_Secrecy, OT.Sig_Secure, OT.Sigy_SigF, OT.DTBS_Integr ity_TOE, OT.EMSEC_Design, 
OT.Tamper_ID and OT.Tamper_Resistance. 
This PP describes the following additional security objectives for the TOE: 
7.1.2 OT.TOE_SSCD_Auth Authentication proof as SSCD 
The TOE shall hold unique identity and authentication data as SSCD and provide security mechanisms to 
identify and to authenticate itself as SSCD. 
7.1.3 OT.TOE_TC_SVD_Exp TOE trusted channel for SVD export 
The TOE shall provide a trusted channel to the CGA to  protect the integrity of the SVD exported to the 
CGA. The TOE shall enable the CGA to detect alteration of the SVD exported by the TOE. 
7.2 Security objectives for the operational environment 
7.2.1 Relation to core PP SSCD KG 
This PP includes the following security objectives for the operational environment as defined in the core 
PP SSCD KG [7]: OE.SVD_Auth, OE.CGA_Qcert, OE .HID_VAD, OE.DTBS_Intend, OE.DTBS_Protect, 
and OE.Signatory. 
This PP substitutes OE.SSCD_Prov_Service from  the core PP by OE.Dev_Prov_Service and adds 
security objectives for the operational environment OE.CGA_SSCD_Auth and OE.CGA_TC_SVD_Imp in 
order to address the additional method of use as SC D/SVD pair generation after delivery to the signatory 
and outside the secure preparation environment. 
7.2.2 OE.Dev_Prov_Service Authentic SSCD provided by SSCD Provisioning Service 
The SSCD Provisioning Service handles authentic devices that implement the TOE, prepares the TOE for 
proof as SSCD to external entities, personalises the TOE for the legitimate user as signatory, links the 
identity of the TOE as SSCD with the identity of the legitimate user, and delivers the TOE to the signatory. 
Note: This objective replaces OE.SSCD_Prov_Service fr om the core PP, which is possible as it does not

imply any additional requirements for the oper ational environment when compared to 
OE.SSCD_Prov_Service (OE.Dev_Prov_Service is a subset of OE.SSCD_Prov_Service). 
7.2.3 OE.CGA_SSCD_Auth Pre-initialisation of the TOE for SSCD authentication 
The CSP shall check by means of the CGA whether the device presented for application of a (qualified) 
certificate holds unique identificati on as SSCD, successfully proved this identity as SSCD to the CGA, 
and whether this identity is linked to the legitimate holder of the device as applicant for the certificate. 
7.2.4 OE.CGA_TC_SVD_Imp CGA trusted channel for SVD import 
The CGA shall detect alteration of the SVD imported from the TOE with the claimed identity of the SSCD. 
The developer prepares the TOE by pre-initialisati on for the delivery to the customer (i.e. the SSCD 
provisioning service) in the development phase not addr essed by a security objective for the operational 
environment. The SSCD Provisioning Service performs initialisation and personalisation as TOE for the 
legitimate user (i.e. the Device holder). If the TOE is delivered to the Device holder with SCD the TOE is a 
SSCD. This situation is addressed by OE.SSCD_Prov_Service except t he additional initialisation of the 
TOE for proof as SSCD and trusted channel to the CG A. If the TOE is delivered to the Device holder 
without a SCD the TOE will be a SSCD only after genera tion of the first SCD/SVD pair. Because this 
SCD/SVD pair generation is perfor med by the signatory in the operational use stage the TOE provides 
additional security functionality addressed by OT .TOE_SSCD_Auth and OT.TOE_TC_SVD_Exp. But this 
security functionality must be initialised by the SSCD Provisioning Service as described in 
OE.Dev_Prov_Service. Therefore this PP substitutes OE.SSCD_Prov_Service by OE.Dev_Prov_Service 
allowing generation of the first SCD/SVD pair after del ivery of the TOE to the Device holder and requiring 
initialisation of security functionality of the TOE. Neve rtheless the additional security functionality must be 
used by the operational environment as descri bed in OE.CGA_SSCD_Auth and OE.CGA_TC_SVD_Imp. 
This approach does not weaken the security objectives of and requirements to the TOE but enforce more 
security functionality of the TOE for additional method of use. Therefore it does not conflict with the CC 
conformance claim to the core PP SSCD KG [7].

7.3.2 Security	objectives	sufficiency	 
The rationale for T.SCD_Divulg, T.SCD_Derive, T. Hack_Phys, T.SigF_Misuse, T.DTBS_Forgery, 
T.Sig_Forgery, P.QSign, A.CGA and A.SCA remains un changed as given in the core PP SSCD KG [7], 
section 7.3.2. The rationale how security objecti ves address the threat T.SVD_Forgery and policies 
P.CSP_QCert, P.Sigy_SSCD and P.Sig_Non-Repud changes as described below. 
T.SVD_Forgery (Forgery of the signature verification data) deals with the forgery of the SVD exported by 
the TOE to the CGA for the generation of the certificate. T.SVD_Forgery is addressed by 
OT.SCD_SVD_Corresp, which ensures correspondence between SVD and SCD and unambiguous 
13

reference of the SVD/SCD pair for the SVD export and signature creation with the SCD, and 
OE.SVD_Auth that ensures the integrity of the SVD exported by the TOE to the CGA and verification of 
the correspondence between the SCD in the SSCD of the signatory and the SVD in the input it provides 
to the certificate generation function of the CS P. Additionally T.SVD_Forgery is addressed by 
OT.TOE_TC_SVD_Exp, which ensures that the TOE sends the SVD in a verifiable form through a trusted 
channel to the CGA, as well as by OE.CGA_TC_SVD_Imp, which provides verification of SVD 
authenticity by the CGA. 
P.CSP_QCert (CSP generates qualified certificates ) provides that the TOE and the SCA may be 
employed to sign data with (qualified) electronic signatures, as defined by the directive  [1], article 5, 
paragraph 1. Directive [1], recital (15) refers to SSCDs to ensure the functionality of advanced signatures. 
The OE.CGA_QCert addresses the requirement of qua lified (or advanced) electronic signatures as being 
based on qualified (or non-qualified) certificates. Ac cording to OT.TOE_SSCD_Auth the copies of the 
TOE will hold unique identity and authentication da ta as SSCD and provide security mechanisms 
enabling the CGA to identify and to authenticate the TOE as SSCD to prove this identity as SSCD to the 
CGA. The OE.CGA_SSCD_Auth ensures that the SP c hecks the proof of the device presented of the 
applicant that it is a SSCD. The OT.SCD_SVD_Corresp ensures that the SVD exported by the TOE to the 
CGA corresponds to the SCD stored in the TOE and used by the signatory. The OT.Lifecycle_Security 
ensures that the TOE detects flaws during the initialisation, personalisation and operational usage. 
P.Sigy_SSCD  (TOE as secure signature creation device ) requires the TOE to meet Annex III of the 
directive. The paragraph 1(a) of Annex III is ensured by OT.SCD_Unique requiring that the SCD used for 
signature creation can practically occurs only once. The OT.SCD_Secrecy OT.Sig_Secure and 
OT.EMSEC_Design and OT.Tamper_Resistance addres s the secrecy of the SCD (cf. paragraph 1(a) of 
Annex III). OT.SCD_Secrecy and OT.Sig_Secure meet the requirement in paragraph 1(b) of Annex III by 
the requirements to ensure that the SCD cannot be derived from SVD, the electronic signatures or any 
other data exported outside the TOE. OT.Sigy_SigF meets the requirement in par agraph 1(c) of Annex III 
by the requirements to ensure that the TOE provides  the signature creation function for the legitimate 
signatory only and protects the SCD against the us e of others. OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE meets the 
requirements in paragraph 2 of Annex III as the TO E must not alter the DT BS/R. The usage of SCD 
under sole control of the signatory is ensured by OT.Lifecycle_Security, OT.SCD/SVD_Gen and 
OT.Sigy_SigF. 
OE.Dev_Prov_Service ensures that the legitimate user obtains a TOE sample as an authentic, initialised 
and personalised TOE from an SSCD Provisioning Se rvice through the TOE delivery procedure. If the 
TOE implements SCD generated under control of t he SSCD Provisioning Service the legitimate user 
receives the TOE as SSCD. If the TOE is delivered to the legitimate user without SCD In the operational 
phase he or she applies for the (qualified) certificate as the Device holder and legitimate user of the TOE. 
The CSP will use the TOE security feature (address ed by the security objectives OT.TOE_SSCD_Auth 
and OT.TOE_TC_SVD_Exp) to check whether the device presented is a SSCD linked to the applicant as 
required by OE.CGA_SSCD_Auth and the received SVD is sent by this SSCD as required by 
OE.CGA_TC_SVD_Imp. Thus the obligation of the SSCD provision service for the first SCD/SVD pair is 
complemented in an appropriate way by the CSP for the SCD/SVD pair generated outside the secure 
preparation environment. 
P.Sig_Non-Repud (Non-repudiation of signatures) deals with th e repudiation of signed data by the 
signatory, although the electronic signature is su ccessfully verified with the SVD contained in their 
certificate valid at the time of signature creation. Th is policy is implemented by the combination of the 
security objectives for the TOE and its operational environment, that ensure t he aspects of signatory’s 
sole control over and responsibility for the electronic signatures generated with the TOE. 
OE.Dev_Prov_Service ensures that the signatory uses an authentic TOE, initialised and personalised for 
the signatory. OE.CGA_QCert ensures t hat the certificate allows to identi fy the signatory and thus to link 
the SVD to the signatory. OE.SVD_Auth and OE.C GA_QCert require the environment to ensure

prEN 14169-4:2012 (E) 
authenticity of the SVD as being exported by the TO E and used under sole control of the signatory. 
OT.SCD_SVD_Corresp ensures that  the SVD exported by the TOE co rresponds to the SCD that is 
implemented in the TOE. OT.SCD_U nique provides that the signatory’s SCD can practically occur just 
once. 
OE.Signatory ensures that the signatory checks that  the SCD, stored in the SSCD received from an 
SSCD provisioning service is in no n-operational state (i.e. the SCD cannot be used before the signatory 
becomes into sole control over the SSCD). The TOE security feature addressed by the security objectives 
OT.TOE_SSCD_Auth and OT.TOE_TC_SVD_Exp su pported by OE.Dev_Prov_Service enables the 
verification whether the device presented by  the applicant is a SSCD as required by 
OE.CGA_SSCD_Auth and the received SVD is sent by the device holding the corresponding SCD as 
required by OE.CGA_TC_SVD_Imp. OT.Sigy_SigF provides that only the signatory may use the TOE for 
signature creation. As prerequisite OE.Signatory ensures  that the signatory keeps their VAD confidential. 
OE.DTBS_Intend, OE.DTBS_Protect and OT.DTBS_In tegrity_TOE ensure that the TOE generates 
electronic signatures only for a DTBS/R that the si gnatory has decided to sign as DTBS. The robust 
cryptographic techniques required by OT.Sig_Secure ensure that only this SCD may generate a valid 
electronic signature that can be su ccessfully verified with the co rresponding SVD used for signature 
verification. The security objective for the TO E OT.Lifecycle_Security (Lifecycle security), 
OT.SCD_Secrecy (Secrecy of the signature cr eation data), OT.EMSEC_Design (Provide physical 
emanations security), OT.Tamper_ID (Tamper detection) and OT.Tamper_Resistance (Tamper 
resistance) protect the SCD against any compromise.

9 Security requirements 
9.1 Security functional requirements 
9.1.1 Use	of	requirement	specifications	 
Common Criteria allow several operations to be performed on functional requirements; refinement, 
selection, assignment, and iteration. Each of thes e operations is used in this PP. Operations not 
performed in this PP are identified in order to enable instantiation of the PP into a Security Target (ST). 
A refinement operation is used to add detail to a require ment, and thus further restricts a requirement. 
Refinement of security requirements is (i) denoted by the word “refinement” in bold text and the added or 
changed words are in bold text, or (ii) included in text as bold text and marked by a footnote. In cases 
where words from a CC requirement were deleted, a se parate attachment indicates the words that were 
removed. 
A selection operation is used to select one or more options  provided by the CC in stating a requirement. 
A selection that has been made in this European standard is indicated as underlined text and the original 
text of the component is given by a footnote. Selections left to be filled in by the ST author appear in 
square brackets with an indication that a selection is to be made, [selection:], and are italicized. 
An assignment operation is used to assign a specific value to an unspecified parameter, such as the 
length of a password. An assignment that that has been made in this European standard is indicated as 
underlined text and the original text of the component is given by a footnote. Assignments left to be filled 
in by the ST author appear in square brackets wi th an indication that an assignment is to be made 
[assignment:], and are italicized. 
An iteration operation is used when a component is repeated with varying operations. Iteration is 
denoted by showing a slash “/”, and the iteration indicator after the component identifier.

9.3.2 TOE	Security	requirements	sufficiency	 
The table demonstrates that each security objective for the TOE is covered by at least one security 
functional requirement. 
The rationale in the core PP SSCD KG, section 9.3.2, is  still valid. It explains how the security functional 
requirements cover the security objectives for th e TOE OT.Lifecycle_Security, OT.SCD/SVD_Gen, 
OT.SCD_Unique, OT.SCD_SVD_Corresp, OT.SCD_ Secrecy, OT.Sig_Secure, OT.Sigy_SigF, 
OT.DTBS_Integrity_TOE, OT.EMSEC_Design, OT.Tamper_ID and OT.Tamper_Resistance. The 
rationale for the security objectives OT.TOE_SSCD_Auth and OT.TOE_TC_SVD_Exp is given below. 
OT.TOE_SSCD_Auth (Authentication proof as SSCD) requires the TOE to provide security mechanisms 
to identify and to authenticate themselves as SSCD, which is directly provided by FIA_API.1 
(Authentication Proof of Identity) . The SFR FIA_UAU.1 allows (additionally to the core PP SSCD KG) 
establishment of the trusted channel before (human) user is authenticated. 
OT.TOE_TC_SVD_Exp (TOE trusted channel for SVD export) requires the TOE to provide a trusted 
channel to the CGA to protect the integrity of the SVD exported to the CGA, which is directly provided by

-	 The SVD transfer for certificate generation is controlled by TSF according to 
FDP_ACC.1/SVD_Transfer and FDP_ACF.1/SVD_Transfer. 
-	 FDP_DAU.2/SVD (Data Authentication with Identity of Guarantor), which requires the TOE to provide 
CGA with the ability to verify evidence of the va lidity of the SVD and the identity of the user that 
generated the evidence.

9.3.4 Rationale	for	chosen	security	assurance	requirements	 
The assurance level for this protection profile is EAL4 augmented. EAL4 allows a developer to attain a 
reasonably high assurance level without the need for highly specialized processes and practices. It is 
considered to be the highest level that could be applied to an existing product line without undue expense 
and complexity. As such, EAL4 is appropriate for commercial products that can be applied to moderate to 
high security functions. The TOE described in this pr otection profile is just such a product. Augmentation 
results from the selection of: 
AVA_VAN.5 Advanced methodical vulnerability analysis 
The TOE is intended to function in a variety of signature creation systems for (qualified) electronic 
signatures. Due to the nature of its intended applicat ion, i.e., the TOE may be issued to users and may 
not be directly under the control of tr ained and dedicated administrators. As  a result, it is imperative that 
misleading, unreasonable and conflicting guidance is  absent from the guidance documentation, and that 
secure procedures for all modes of operation have been addressed. Insecure states should be easy to 
detect. The TOE shall be shown to be highly resistant to penetration attacks to meet the security 
objectives OT.SCD_Secrecy, OT.Sigy_SigF and OT.Sig_Secure.
